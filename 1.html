  <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>

  <p>All of these ranges are part of the frequency bands called Industrial,
   Scientific, And Medical (ISM) radio bands and were originally reserved
   for non-commercial use. Depending on the usage, the tags are designed to
   operate in any one of these ranges. The material of the object being tagged
   and the read range required are the main factors in selection of frequency.
    Objects with water content absorb frequencies in certain ranges but have no
    effect on frequencies in another range.</p>
